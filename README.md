# Drum_kit
Created an interactive user interface that simulates a virtual drum set, allowing users to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys or clicking on the drum elements. Utilised event handling in JavaScript to enable real-time sound production and responsiveness. Implemented CSS styling for a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
